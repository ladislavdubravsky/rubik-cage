# Rubik's cage analysis

## Webapp build

Install [webassembly target and trunk](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction#install-webassembly-target).

```
trunk build --release
```

or `trunk serve` to serve with hot reloading.

## Playing with core logic

Run `cargo test` for core logic tests; explore and modify the tests to e.g. evaluate positions by searching the game tree.
